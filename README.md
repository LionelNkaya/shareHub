# [ShareHub](https://sharehub.lionelnkaya.com/) 

Have you ever wanted to share to Facebook or Twitter but feel like every time you do connect to this platforms you end up spending a lot more time than what you wanted/expected?

The idea of shareHub is to create a webpage that allows people to share a post on social media: Twitter (tweets) & Facebook (links to content) without scrolling through their account.

When you share with shareHub after you shared, your social media page closes so tat you can share your ideas with the world without loosing innumerable hours scrolling through content.

Enjoy! and God bless.
